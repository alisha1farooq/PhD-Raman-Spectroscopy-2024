# PhD-Raman-Spectroscopy-2024
MATLAB and Python scripts for single-cell analysis

This repository contains code used during my PhD research at the University of Leeds for the preprocessing and classification of single-cell Raman spectral data.

The goal of the project was to distinguish between healthy, pre-cancerous, and cancerous states in oesophageal cell lines using label-free Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### ðŸ”§ MATLAB Scripts â€“ *Preprocessing Pipeline*
Located in the `MATLAB/` folder:

- `script1.m`: Sets up file paths, dataset indices, and calibration parameters for batch processing `.wdf` Raman files.
- `script2.m`: Performs preprocessing on raw spectra, including:
  - Calibration using reference peaks
  - Spline interpolation
  - Smoothing and baseline correction
  - Normalisation
  - Output of cleaned spectra and summary statistics

> These scripts prepared the data for use in Python-based classification.

### ðŸ§  Python Scripts â€“ *PCA/LDA Classification*
Located in the `Python/` folder:

- `preprocess_and_classify.py`: Loads cleaned spectral data and applies:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - 2D/3D plotting of class separation
- `baseline_correction.py`: Implements signal cleaning methods such as Asymmetric Least Squares and Standard Normal Variate (SNV)
- `gui_pca_lda.py` *(optional)*: A PyQt-based GUI to allow users to visually inspect and classify Raman spectra (if included)

> These scripts were collaboratively developed. My contribution involved running and adapting the analysis for my datasets, finetuning preprocessing parameters, and interpreting PCA/LDA outputs.
